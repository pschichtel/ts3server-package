This is a simple script that generates a Debian package for the TeamSpeak 3 Server.

Simply clone this repository and run the ```build.sh``` script inside the repo.

By default the script will build the latest version as of making the last changes to the script. If new versions were released since then, building a package for those only requires changing the version variable at the top of the script.
